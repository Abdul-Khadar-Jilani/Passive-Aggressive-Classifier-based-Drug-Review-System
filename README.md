# Passive Aggressive Classifier based Drug Recommendation System

Run the code and save two models and copy two saved models in seperate folder called model.

I trained upto 120 medical conditions and got accuracy of nearly 94%.... we need to increase accuracy by optimization techniques.

we can by reducing training data also I think...

generate images plots , bar graphs and confusion matrix whatever it maybe for minimum of 10 samples for documentation/paper purpose.
